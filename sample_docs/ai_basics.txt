
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence 
        in machines. Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to 
        learn from data. Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers 
        to process complex patterns. Natural language processing helps computers 
        understand human language.
